     *   FGS up, but sustained pauses surrender it.
     * - [EngineState.PAUSED_BATTERY_SAVER]: never resign (#313). No WorkManager constraint means
     *   "Battery Saver is off" and the system does not deliver its change broadcast to a stopped
     *   app, so a resigned engine could only come back through a tap-to-resume notification.
     *   Staying up costs one wake per [BATTERY_SAVER_RECHECK_MS] and resumes the moment Battery
     *   Saver ends.
     * - [idleInducedNetworkPause]: never resign on a [EngineState.PAUSED_WIFI] or
     *   [EngineState.PAUSED_METERED_WIFI] pause while the device is asleep (#335). Sleep cuts the
     *   network, or drops Wi-Fi so the default network becomes mobile data or a metered hotspot,
     *   which a user with mobile Off sees as either pause. A resigned engine could only come back
     *   through a tap-to-resume notification, so it stayed off until the user picked up the
     *   phone. Staying up costs nothing while asleep: the loop waits on the network callback, not
     *   on an alarm. Thirty awake minutes in either pause still resign, as before.
     * - [EngineState.PAUSED_NETWORK_BLOCKED]: never resign (#335). The network is up, so a
     *   network constraint would be met at once and the engine would resign, restart and block
     *   again; the loop resumes on the network callback instead.
