/**
 * Unit-level lifecycle contract for [PhantomWebViewPool], the process's only WebView pool.
 *
 * The pool's suspend lifecycle ([initialize]/[acquire]/[release]/[destroy]) hops to
 * `Dispatchers.Main` internally because WebView is thread-affine to its creating (main) thread.
 * Under Robolectric the test runs on the main thread, so a `runBlocking { pool.initialize() }`
 * called inline would post the `Dispatchers.Main` body to the main looper and then block the
 * very thread that drains it — a self-deadlock. Two things avoid that:
 *   1. [ShadowLooper.idleMainLooperConstantly] makes the paused main looper auto-execute every
 *      task posted to it, even while the main thread sits idle.
 *   2. [drive] runs each suspend call inside `runBlocking` on a *background* thread, leaving the
 *      main thread free to service those posted `Dispatchers.Main` continuations.
 * This is deliberately NOT `runTest` + `MainDispatcherRule`: the pool needs the REAL Robolectric
 * Main looper to run its `withContext(Dispatchers.Main)` bodies, not a virtual test dispatcher.
 *
 * Scope note: WebSettings lockdown (allowFileAccess etc.) and `setDataDirectorySuffix` (finding
 * #4) are intentionally NOT covered here — they live in the instrumented
 * `PhantomWebViewPoolInstrumentedTest` / `FauxxApp`. This pins the pooling, permit, state-clear,
 * and teardown behavior.
