/**
 * The engine keeps working with the screen off (#335): it holds the CPU only while an action runs,
 * sets a wakeup for the next one, measures its waits against elapsed realtime (which keeps counting
 * while the CPU sleeps), and does not give up the service over a network outage that comes from
 * the device sleeping.
 *
 * A suspended CPU is modelled the way it behaves: NO loop pass runs and NO coroutine time passes,
 * while elapsed realtime ([FakeClock]) jumps. [advance] is the awake case, where both move together.
